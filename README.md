# percona-pt-stalk-functions (percona-toolkit)

While the files here have descriptive names, the examples for these pt-stalk functions assume that the script is called /root/stalk-trigger.sh

You can test the scripts by temporarily uncommenting the last line and invoking /root/stalk-trigger.sh outside of pt-stalk
